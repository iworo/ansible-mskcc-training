  connection: local   # connection local means "talk to the local machine" (usually indicates an SDK is present)

  gather_facts: no  # this is a kind of "pre step" that would execute before any tasks, it taps into "setup.py"
                       # where "setup.py" wants to define the variable "ansible_facts". This generally only works
                       # for the connection types ssh (Linux), winrm (Windows), network_cli (popular network devices)

  # look in this folder for python scripts I might be calling!!
